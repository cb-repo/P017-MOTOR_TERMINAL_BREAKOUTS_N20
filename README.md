<img src="assets/1.0_BREAKOUT.png" width="400">

Motor terminals are traditionally small and flimsy, making it hard to guarantee a reliable solder connection.
MOTOR TERMINAL BREAKOUTS are designed to simplify and strengthen these solder joints, enabling more reliable operation especally in high vibration environments: orignially designed for combat robotics but is suitable for any application using these motors. 
  
Developed, assembled, and tested in [Christchurch, New Zealand](https://www.google.co.nz/maps/place/Christchurch+New+Zealand), by Connor Benton.

## FEATURES
